# Data-Structures-and-Algorithm-DSA-

📌 Repository Description

This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) programs, implemented mainly in C/C++/Java. It covers fundamental and advanced concepts including arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, searching, sorting, recursion, and dynamic programming.

The goal of this repository is to practice problem-solving, strengthen logical thinking, and build a strong foundation in DSA for coding interviews and competitive programming.

🔹 Languages Used: C, C++
🔹 Content: Implementation of data structures, algorithmic techniques, and practice problems
🔹 Purpose: Learning, revision, and interview preparation
